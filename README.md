Hi everyone, my name is AbdulNasser,
a student of computer systems engineering at Palestine Technical University Kadoorie.
I look forward to working in the future with one of the greatest companies in the world,
whether in the field of software or hardware.
I am interested in learning technologies from the ground up, not only learning new technologies,
and I believe that the best education is teaching the basics of any subject,
for example.
If you want to be a professional software engineer, you have to master the algorithms, 
which were founded by the Muslim Al-Khwarizmi,
and also have to master the data structures that represent the infrastructure for data distribution inside the computer.
And also  you must learn the computer structure and hardware components of the computer 
and how to implement the operations that take place inside the central processing unit 
and learn the process of compatibility between hardware and software through learning the operating systems.
